## üìù Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This website requires Node and NPM to be installed in order to run locally. You can view the NPM documentation to [learn more about installation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

You may also need the [Netlify CLI](https://cli.netlify.com/) to test certain features such as the Stripe donation buttons. If you need access to Netlify, you can request access in [#committee-website](https://the-collab-lab.slack.com/archives/CUS0DJ614) and someone will invite you to the Netlify project.

### Installation

Clone the website using [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

```shell
gh repo clone the-collab-lab/website
```

Run `npm i` in the repository directory to install all the necessary packages and to set up [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) for pre-commit linting.

### GraphQL Introspection

Use this link to [access the playground and schema for our GraphQL endpoint](https://api-us-east-1.graphcms.com/v2/ckfwosu634r7l01xpco7z3hvq/master).

Depending on your IDE, you may have the ability to introspect the schema and unlock type checking in your editor:

#### VS Code

1. Install both the [GraphQL for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kumar-harsh.graphql-for-vscode) and [GraphQL: Language Feature Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql) plugins.
2. Create a `graphql.config.json` and copy/paste the json found below.
3. VSCode will automatically introspect the schema without having to create a schema file.

#### IntelliJ

1. Install the [GraphQL Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8097-graphql).
2. Create a `.graphqlconfig` file and copy/paste the json found below.
3. Use the GraphQL plugin to generate a `schema.graphql` file from the config.

The JSON config for either VS Code's or IntelliJ's config file is:

```json
{
  "name": "Collab Lab GraphQL Schema",
  "schemaPath": "schema.graphql",
  "extensions": {
    "endpoints": {
      "Default GraphQL Endpoint": {
        "url": "https://api-us-east-1.graphcms.com/v2/ckfwosu634r7l01xpco7z3hvq/master",
        "headers": {
          "user-agent": "JS GraphQL"
        },
        "introspect": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For other platforms, consult the documentation for your IDE.

## üî¨ Usage

- All of our queries and data fetching methods can be found in `pages/graphql`.
- The `src/_data` directory is used to create variables and pass data to the `*.liquid` files.
- The `src/assets` is where all of our JavaScript, stylesheets, image assets, fonts, and other asset files can be found.
- The `src/_includes` hosts the main layout file (defined in `src/pages.11tydata.json`) along with any additional reusable templates.
- All of the `src/*.11tydata.js` files are used to create variables and pass data to the `src/*.html` files, which generate the different pages on the site.

To run the site:

```shell
npm run dev # starts the dev server on port 8080
```

To build the site:

```shell
npm run build # builds the site and outputs it in the /build/ folder
```

To build and run the build version of the site:

```shell
npm run build:serve # builds and serves the site in localhost:5000
```
