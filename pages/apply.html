<h2>You can do this!</h2>

<p>The Collab Lab exists to help early-career developers gain their footholds in tech. Our participants are all early-career developers, many of them veterans of coding bootcamps or self-study, some of them a year or two into their tech careers.</p>

<p>We don’t teach coding, so you need to already have a baseline of skills to get in, but what you gain from Collab Lab is experience working on a software team, led by people in the industry, on a project structured in a way very close to what you’d see at many companies.</p>
