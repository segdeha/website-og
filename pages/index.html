    >Collab Lab gave me agile team experience I didn’t get through my coding
    bootcamp. I honestly don’t think I would have landed that first job offer
    without being able to talk about my experience with pair programming and
    resolving merge conflicts. Beyond that, I made some great friends!</q

<h3>Join us!</h3>
<p>
  <a href="/about-us/#participants">Successful Collab Lab participants</a>
  come in having already learned basic web development and programming concepts.
  We don’t teach coding; we teach collaboration! You don’t need a ton of
  experience, but
  <strong>you should have completed the equivalent of a coding bootcamp</strong>
  where you’ve learned (at a minimum) basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and have
  completed a project or two in
  <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>.

  <a href="/about-us/#mentors">Our mentors</a> are professional web developers
  and engineering leaders. Project or product management skills are helpful,
  though not strictly required. Mentors work in pairs to guide cohorts and we do
  our best to ensure complimentary skills among the mentors on the team.
