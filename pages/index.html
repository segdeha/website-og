    <q
      >Collab Lab gave me agile team experience I didn‚Äôt get through my coding
      bootcamp. I honestly don‚Äôt think I would have landed that first job offer
      without being able to talk about my experience with pair programming and
      resolving merge conflicts. Beyond that, I made some great friends!</q
