  The Collab Lab exists to help early-career developers gain their footholds in
  tech by providing real-world experience working on software teams.
</p>
<h2 id="origin-story">Our Origin Story</h2>
<p>
  In June of 2019, <a href="/who-we-are/#founder">Andrew Hedges</a> grabbed a
  quick beer before
  <a
    href="https://www.meetup.com/Portland-JR-DEVELOPER-Meetup/events/256869529/"
    >that month’s PDX Junior Developer Meetup</a
  >
  with <a href="https://www.pdxcodeguild.com">PDX Code Guild</a> graduate Scott
  Stine. The two were talking about the difficulties involved in making the leap
  from coding bootcamp to first job as a professional web developer when Andrew
  came up with the idea for The Collab Lab.
</p>
<p>
  At the Meetup, Andrew recruited Caitlyn Greffly—who at the time was attempting
  to make the transition into her first developer job—to participate and it was
  clear the idea had merit.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Collab Lab kicked off our first cohort that August</strong> with
  Scott, Caitlyn, Stacie Taylor, and Kate Sowles participating as developers
  with Andrew mentoring the group through the 8-week project.
</p>
<p>
  Since we launched, the response to Collab Lab has been overwhelmingly
  positive, further confirming the need for what we’re doing. As of November,
  2020, we’ve worked with 60 early-career developers in 6 countries and are
  working hard to scale up the program to accommodate demand.

    >Collab Lab gave me a framework for how to navigate relationships on a
    software development team. I feel more confident and prepared walking into
    my first dev job with the communication experience I gained through all of
    the code reviews, retrospectives, and pair programming sessions. So thankful
    for the program and the supportive mentors who make it happen!</q
