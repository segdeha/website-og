<h3>Join us!</h3>
<p>
  Successful Collab Lab developers come in having already learned basic web
  development and programming concepts. We don’t teach coding; we teach
  collaboration! You don’t need a ton of experience, but
  <strong>you should have completed the equivalent of a coding bootcamp</strong>
  where you’ve learned (at a minimum) basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and have
  completed a project or two in
  <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>.
