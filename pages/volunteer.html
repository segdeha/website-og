  The `{%- capture gridItems -%}` block captures everything inside of it
  for rendering later. It won't appear in the HTML until we invoke it.
  We do that after the `{%- endcapture -%}` statement.

<h2 id="roles">What our volunteers do</h2>
<p>
  The Collab Lab is run by an amazing bunch of volunteers that do different things to keep the lights on.
</p>

<h3>Project Team Mentors</h3>
<p>
  These folks are professional engineers who spend 8 weeks leading teams of early-career engineers through building an
  app on a software development team, hosting 1-hour weekly synchronous meetings each weekend, holding office hours to
  assist developers, participating in code reviews, and presenting learning modules.
</p>
<p>
  Commitment: ~5 hours/week for 10 weeks
</p>
<p> Ready to do this? Tell us about you through our <a href="https://airtable.com/shr8rMObHvknZ0nZ0">mentor
  application form!</a></p>

<h3>Career Lab Volunteers</h3>
<p>
  Each quarter, we run Career Lab, a 2-week extension on the core Collab Lab project where our Collabies get the
  opportunity to optimize their Linkedin and practice mock job fit and technical with folks who are interviewing
  engineers every day in their respective roles. These folks take time to coach our Collabies through the job hunt and
  interview process.
</p>
<p>
  Commitment: ~5 hours per week for 2 weeks
</p>

<h3>Automation heroes</h3>
<p>
  Behind the scenes of The Collab Lab, our Automation Heroes build automations to help us be more efficient in doing the
  work to keep the lights on for our programs. They write scripts to automate team setup, ensure all the teams’ projects
  are up to date, and maintain our website with GraphCMS, 11ty, and Netlify.</p>

<h3>Community managers</h3>
<p>These folks keep our community engaged and growing! They organize and host our Tech Talk series, manage our social
  media, and keep our internal channels poppin’ with fun and helpful events and conversations. </p>
<h3>Code of Conduct team</h3>
<p> At the Collab Lab, we’re dedicated to creating and maintaining an inclusive and psychologically safe space for
  everyone in our community to learn and grow in. Our Code of Conduct responders are professionally trained and
  ensure everyone in our community is upholding the commitment to our Code of Conduct.

<blockquote>
  <p>As a mentor, I work to give Collab Lab cohorts the experience of building and deploying a production app on a
    high-performing, psychologically safe team using the same principles and practices that have helped me be successful
    as a professional engineering manager. Our participants learn firsthand how powerful and effective a healthy,
    functional team is. With this experience as a reference point, they leave empowered to advocate for themselves,
    their colleagues, and ready to transform organizations for the better.
