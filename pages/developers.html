<p>
  Our developers enter The Collab Lab with a strong baseline of coding skills
  including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. They leave with experience in how
  software teams work.
</p>
<p>
  To participate in a Collab Lab cohort means buying into a
  <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means"
    >growth mindset</a
  >, opening yourself to learning, and taking risks in a relatively low-stakes
  setting. Seasoned technologists guide these early-career developers as they
  pair program, review each othersâ€™ code, and submit & merge pull requests. They
  are also coached on how to be effective on a fully-distributed (i.e. remote)
  team by
  <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/">
    people who do it every day for a living </a
  >.
